 In order to run run_analysis.R file one has to first download the dataset from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
 Then extract the data from zip in a new folder and in the run_analysis.R script set the pathdata variable to the path of the new folder.
 The run_analysis.R will then perform following - 
 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject called "TidySet.txt"
